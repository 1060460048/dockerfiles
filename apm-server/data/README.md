==========

[Elastic APM][1] is an application performance monitoring system built on the
Elastic Stack. It allows you to monitor software services and applications in
real time, collecting detailed performance information on response time for
incoming requests, database queries, calls to caches, external HTTP requests,
etc. This makes it easier to pinpoint and fix performance problems quickly.

Elastic APM also automatically collects unhandled errors and exceptions. Errors
are grouped based primarily on the stacktrace, so you can identify new errors
as they appear and keep an eye on how many times specific errors happen.
